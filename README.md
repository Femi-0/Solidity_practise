# Solidity practise

This is a smart contract to demonstarte basic concepts programmable on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

In short, it demonstartes the ability of a smart contract to act as an escrow, although the exact specifications for an escrow are not strictly met in this example, as it is only a proof of concept.

The "joint_savings.sol" script is very clearly commented; to reitireate:

  - Two accounts are set as beneficiaries.
  - ETH is deposited into the smart contract.
  - ETH is withdrawn to the beneficiaries.

The images below are of the following transactions:

The script can be run and debugged using the online IDE, Remix (remix.ethereum.org).
